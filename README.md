# ray-tracing

Animation that dynamically explains and demonstrates the ray tracing algorithm.

The animation features a simple scene with two spheres, a plane (the floor) and two sources of lights configurable in position and color. The image's plane is shown along with the observer's position (a cone). Triggering the animation allows the user to trace the primary and secondary rays.
